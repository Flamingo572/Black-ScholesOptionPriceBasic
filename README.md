# Black-Scholes and Implied Volatility
## Black-Scholes EU Option Price

#### ImpliedVolatility Function  
Function which can be run as a static function will take the parameters specified in the Implied Volatility heading. It will return a float of the implied Volatility given a tolerance that can be specified in the function called TOLERANCE  

### testScript.py  
Is the test script and can be used as a benchmark if any modifications are made
